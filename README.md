# Google Fiber <br>

Google Fiber provides people and businesses with fiber optic internet. The customer service team needs to design a dashboard where Fiber uses business intelligence to monitor and improve customer satisfaction.
The team needs to understand how often customers  phone customer support again after their first inquiry; this will help leaders understand whether the team is able to answer customer questions the first time.
Further, leaders want to explore trends in repeat calls to identify why customers are having to call more than once, as well as how to improve the overall customer experience.
